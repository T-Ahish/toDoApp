# toDoApp
My Very First JavaScript App, This includes simple function to add and delete To-Do with styles added through SASS.

## Details
This is my very first step into the JavaScript FullStack. Currently the App does not have any backend Code, meaning all the To Dos we add in the page does not get stored. I might comeback to this project with new additional improvements and good design or Better yet, I might create a V2 of this app. So Stay tuned!
